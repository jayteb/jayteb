Hi, I’m Jamilyn Mooteb.
I’m interested in physics, programming, and great stories.
I’m currently learning how to program a simple game.
I'm originally from Yap, a Pacific island.
I'm a graduate student in Electrical Engineering.
I chose my major because I wanted to dive deeper into my interests.
A fun fact about me is: I can weave a hat.
What do I want to learn from EE 205? how to be a good software engineer
A book or movie I'd recommend is:  Hidden Figures
